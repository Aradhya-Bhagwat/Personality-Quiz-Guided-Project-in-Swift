# 🦁 Personality Quiz App (Swift)

A simple and fun iOS app built using **Swift** and **UIKit** that determines a user’s personality type — **Lion**, **Rabbit**, **Turtle**, or **Cat** — based on their responses to a short quiz.

This guided project helped me explore and understand various iOS development concepts including **views**, **navigation controllers**, **modal presentations**, **tab bars**, and the use of different **UIKit components** to build interactive interfaces.

- 🎨 **UIKit-Based Interface** – Designed using `Storyboard` and `Interface Builder`.  
- 🔁 **Multiple Views** – Implemented using modal segues, navigation controllers, and tab bars.  
- 📚 **Learning-Focused** – Built as a guided learning project to strengthen knowledge of Swift and iOS UI components.
